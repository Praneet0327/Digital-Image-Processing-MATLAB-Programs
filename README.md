## Introduction
This repository contains a series of MATLAB programs that cover a range of essential topics in Digital Image Processing. These programs serve as a practical guide for students, researchers, and anyone interested in learning how to process and analyze images using MATLAB.

## Programs

### Geometric Transformations
- **Image Rotation**
- **Image Scaling**
- **Image Translation**

These programs demonstrate how to apply basic geometric transformations to images, including rotating, scaling, and translating an image.

### FFT and Fourier Transform
- **1-D and 2-D FFT of an Image**
- **2-D Fourier Transform (DFT)**
- **Masking with DFT**

Learn how to display the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of an image in both 1-D and 2-D. Apply the Two-dimensional Fourier Transform to represent the content of an image using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and perform masking operations.

### Contrast Stretching, Histogram, and Bit Plane Display
- **Contrast Stretching of a Low Contrast Image**
- **Histogram and Histogram Equalization**
- **Bit Planes Display of an Image**

This set of programs helps you enhance the contrast of low-contrast images, understand and manipulate image histograms, and display the bit planes of an image.

### Statistical Computations
- **Mean**
- **Standard Deviation**
- **Correlation Coefficient**

Compute and analyze the statistical properties of an image, including mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient.

### Image Smoothening Filters
- **Mean Filtering**
- **Median Filtering**

Implement image smoothing filters to reduce noise and enhance image quality using mean and median filtering techniques.

### Image Sharpening Filters and Edge Detection
- **Image Sharpening Filters**
- **Edge Detection using Gradient Filters**

Learn how to apply image sharpening filters to enhance edges and details. Perform edge detection using gradient filters to identify and highlight significant edges in an image.

### Image Compression
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**
- **Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM)**
- **Huffman Coding**

Explore image compression techniques using DCT, DPCM, and Huffman coding to reduce image file sizes while maintaining quality.
